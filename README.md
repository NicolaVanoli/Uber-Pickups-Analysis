# Uber Pickups Analysis
In this work I try to give a visualization of the uber pickup system in NYC, by analyzing the times the
services were delivered, the duration of trips and the starting and ending points.
The goal of this report is trying to track the habits of the newyorkers: what is the time of day when uber
services are most in demand? What about the month? How long does in average a trip last?
With the help of our data, we will be able to rise hypothesis that can answer these and other questions.
